# Three-must-know-approaches-for-computing-the-Fibonacci-sequence-in-Cpp

This code explains how to compute the Fibonacci sequence in Cpp by using three must-know approaches. The webpage explaining this code is given here:

https://aleksandarhaber.com/three-must-know-methods-for-computing-fibonacci-sequences-in-c/

We use the three approaches:

1. Pure recursion (the inefficient one).

2. Vector STL approach (more efficient one).

3. Memoization approach (most efficient one).

The timing results are:

1. The Fibonacci sequence of n=30 by using recursion is: 832040. Time: 7337800 nanoseconds.

2. The Fibonacci sequence of n=30 by using vectors (STL) is: 832040. Time: 30400 nanoseconds.

3. The Fibonacci sequence of n=30 by using memoization is: 832040. Time: 900 nanosecond
